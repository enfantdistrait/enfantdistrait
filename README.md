## **🌴 About me**
I'm Thomas. I have been passionate about programming and creating digital projects since I was a child.
For over four and a half years, I have been coding a wide variety of applications, exploring everything from simple scripts to complex systems.
I particularly excel in Python and web development, though I am adaptable and eager to take on projects of any kind. 
I am constantly striving to improve my skills and expand my expertise.
