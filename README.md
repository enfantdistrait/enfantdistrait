## Introducing myself ðŸ‘‹
Â« Since I was little I have been fascinated by computers and programming. I started my first creations at the age of 9 where I coded games and batch tools on my mother's old computer without a connection.
At 11 I had my first high-performance PC with a connection. Over the years I was able to do a lot of projects on my own, small tests in python, minecraft servers and many other things.
Today I am starting to share and do real projects, which will mainly be on this github page.
About myself? I am French but bilingual... well I think ahah. I was born and I live in the region, I am a student. Â»
